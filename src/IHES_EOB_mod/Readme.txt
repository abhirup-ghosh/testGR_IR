	# Description

	EOB for non-spinning binaries, main features

	- logarithmic contributions to the conservative dynamics;
 
	- resummed horizon-absorption contribution to the orbital
	angular momentum loss; 

	- a speciÔ¨Åc radial component of the radiation reaction
	force implied by consistency with the azimuthal one;

	- EOB-light-ring  based procedure for determining NQC
          corrections to the multipolar waveform;

	- NR completion using Caltech-Cornell-CITA group for mass
	ratios q = (1,2,3,4,6) and test mass limit simulations;
