	The code needs only a running standard Matlab installation,
	and the compilation of few MEX files.

	To generate the documentation type
	>> MakeDoc
	at Matlab prompt. A directory Doc/ and html files will be
	created.
	
	Perturbative (quasi-normal-mode tables) and numerical
	relativity data can be passed to the code in the way described
	here below. 


	# MEX files
	
	Some routines are written in C and MEX files need to be
	compiled. This can be done by simply running in Matlab the
	script compilemex.m, ie
	>> cd EOB/
	>> compilemex
	You may need to edit the script and options inside depending
	on your system. 


	# QNM data

	If you want to generate waveforms with ringdown, you need
	perturbative data with Kerr QNM frequencies. At the moment the
	code works with ASCII tables organized in subdirectory and files
	as follows

	1. A main directory, default "DataQNMs", whose absolute path and 
	   name must be pass to the EOB code (see EOBSet.m and examples)
 	
	2. l-multipole directories, named "DataQNMs/l[2-9]"
	
	3. Data files with index n (overtones), l, and m, named
	"n[0-9]l[2-9]m[0-9].dat"

	Example

		DataQNM/l2/n0l2m0.dat

	# NR data for NQC corrections

	The calibration of NQC correction needs input data from
	numerical relativity. Data must be supplied in a file in ASCII
	format. An example file is given in  

		  DataNR/NRpts4NQC.dat
